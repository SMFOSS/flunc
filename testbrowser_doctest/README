For now this must be run against an already running instance, you should 
twiddle the variables in configuration.py to point to the instance. These
tests leave behind cruft that can be cleaned out using cleanup.py 
if you have configured a cleanup_user in configuration.py 

This package should be linked in as its own Product under your zope instance
it can than be run using: 

zopectl test -s Products.testbrowser_doctest

Since each test invokes a new browser instance, the logout test was bundled 
with the login test. The tests still need to be invoked in order, however, 
since the site may only contain one user and project of the same name and 
there is no internal framework to delete these data without the Zope framework

login
create_user
create_project
edit_project
logout
