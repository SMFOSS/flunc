Since each test invokes a new browser instance, the logout test was bundled 
with the login test. The tests still need to be invoked in order, however, 
since the site may only contain one user and project of the same name and 
there is no internal framework to delete these data without the Zope framework

login
create_user
create_project
edit_project
logout
