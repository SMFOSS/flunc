Added hierarchal namespaces to tests
Formerly, tests lived in a flat namespace.  Using --recursive, one
could put all tests under the root directory into a single namespace.
Now each directory has a namespace associated with it.  Tests or
suites with single names refer to items in the same namespace (that
is, the same directory).  You may refer to the bar test or suite in
the foo subdirectory as 

foo.bar

If a suite has the same name as the subdirectory name, you may refer
to it either with the full specification

foo.foo

or with shorthand

foo

To refer to the global namespace, preface the name of the test, suite,
or path with a dot

.foo.bar

refers to the bar suite or test under the foo directory under the root
directory.  

These changes should be backwards compatible with existing tests and
were made to facilitate test organization with the hope of providing
the flexibility to manipulate namespaces when tests live in multiple
locations on disc.
