Add two twill extensions to checkbox.py: not_selected, is_enabled.
Change is_selected to work correctly with checkboxes, I think.

Don't display BadRequest exceptions when calling zope_delobject();
those are normal and just add a lot of noise.

Added twill extension to support xpath. This introduces a dependency on lxml.
There is 1 function added: find_in_xpath
find_in_xpath runs a find command on the html result of an xpath expression
For example:
extend_with flunc.xpath
find_in_xpath "People" "//div[@id='oc-pageNav']"

Altered the namespace behavior;  now, there is no leading dot to
specify the global namespace.  Instead, we use a scope-based model:

1. items (tests, suites, configuration) is first looked up relavent to
the current (local) namespace

2. if they are not found locally, they are looked up in the global namespace

The dot is still used for namespace separation.  So looking up foo.bar
will first look for the namespace foo in the local namespace;  if this
exists, it will try to look up bar in that.  If foo is not a namespace
relavent to the current one, it will try to look up foo.bar in the
global namespace.

Added hierarchal namespaces to tests
Formerly, tests lived in a flat namespace.  Using --recursive, one
could put all tests under the root directory into a single namespace.
Now each directory has a namespace associated with it.  Tests or
suites with single names refer to items in the same namespace (that
is, the same directory).  You may refer to the bar test or suite in
the foo subdirectory as 

foo.bar

If a suite has the same name as the subdirectory name, you may refer
to it either with the full specification

foo.foo

or with shorthand

foo

To refer to the global namespace, preface the name of the test, suite,
or path with a dot

.foo.bar

refers to the bar suite or test under the foo directory under the root
directory.  

These changes should be backwards compatible with existing tests and
were made to facilitate test organization with the hope of providing
the flexibility to manipulate namespaces when tests live in multiple
locations on disc.
