This is a small collection of twill scripts that run against OpenPlans. 
These were tested using twill-0.8.5 (http://twill.idyll.org)
twill must be present and available to the zope instance in its python
path to run these tests

link this directory into <your instance>/Products as OpenPlans_twill_tests
tests should be runnable by executing: 

zopectl test -s Products.OpenPlans_twill_tests

These are set up to be run by the zope test runner against a fixture 
instance created ad hoc for the the tests. local_test_config.twill 
can be altered to force running against a particular instance. 

These may also be executed by running:  
python run_all_twill_tests.py <url to openplans site>

these tests depend on each other, and run as a suite, though they can be 
somewhat individually run. 

The defined suite order is: 

local_test_config.twill   (should always be first to define the configuration variables) 
test_create_user.twill    (needs to be run once before test_login_form.twill will work)
test_login_form.twill     (needs to be run next to establish a login for the other tests)
test_create_project.twill (needs to be run once before test_edit_project.twill will work)
test_edit_project.twill 
test_logout.twill


no automatic cleanup is done when this is run outside of the zope testing framework. 
don't expect to be able to create a user or a project successfully in the same 
instance twice.  (there is a cleanup script in testbrowser_doctest)
