testbrowser_unittest
====================

This is a sample test suite for the OpenCore software
(http://www.openplans.org/projects/opencore/).
The tests use the unittest framework.
This directory should be copied to or linked to from
the zope $INSTANCE_HOME/Products . Tests may then be run with 

zopectl test -s Products.testbrowser_unittest

This test suite does not use the Five testbrowser currently (the
useFiveTB flag has zero functionality).  The flag 'inzopectl' controls
whether the tests are run against a static fixture defined in
configuration.py (if inzopectl is False) or if it creates and runs its
tests against a new fixture (if inzopectl is True).

The tests may be cleaned up by running:

python cleanup.py
